    <h4>NodeJS:</h4>
    <p> Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine (V8 Engine).
        Node.js was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and its latest version is v0.10.36.</p>
    <p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable
        network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it 
        lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across 
        distributed devices. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which 
        simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent. Features of 
        Node.js: Following are some of the important features that make Node.js the first choice of 
        software architects. Asynchronous and Event Driven − All APIs of Node.js library are 
        asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits 
        for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it and a notification
         mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call</p>
    <p>Very Fast − Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast 
        in code execution.
        
        Single Threaded but Highly Scalable − Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping.
         Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly
          scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. 
          Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much 
          larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.
        
        No Buffering − Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the
         data in chunks.
        
        License − Node.js is released under the MIT license.
        
        what is node by sending response in HTML and JSON format
        
        Node.js Javascript Web Development Front End Technology The send () and json () functions are
         used for sending the response to the client directly from the server. The send () method will
          send the data in a string format, whereas the json () function will send the same in JSON 
          format.</p>
